## Learning Selenium

This is just a personal repository I am using to try my hand at selenium UI testing using java.


### Details
- UI Testing project using the roomstogo.com website.
- Using maven for build
- Running two suites of tests. One suite is for the desktop site and one is for mobile.
- Using [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/starrett67/LearningSelenium) for running tests
